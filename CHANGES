Revision history for POE::Component::Client::DNS
================================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

---------------
0.90 2000.08.??
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.90 to indicate pretty
good stability but the need for some beta testing.

Extracted the code from a medium-sized hack I wrote to look up
addresses for long lists of domains, cleaned it up, made the interface
more useful, commented the code, documented it, and made it a module.
